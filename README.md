# SIM Switch

This app is handy if you often switch your data SIM. With this app, you can check and change the default data SIM from the Quick Settings.

This app adds a Quick Settings tile. When you add it to your Quick Settings, it shows the current default data SIM name.

Tapping it opens the SIM settings, where you can change the default data SIM.

To display the current data SIM name in the Quick Settings tile, please open the app once, and allow the permission.
